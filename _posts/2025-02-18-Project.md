# Creating an SFML project

SFML is a cross-platform library and uses cmake as it's build system. If you are already familiar with cmake and c++ toolchains then you can get started with the cmake template project [here](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project)

For more specific instructions or if you are just getting started, select your target platform (i.e. the one you want your SFML project to _run_ on):
- [Windows](/posts/Windows)
- Mac
- Linux
- iOS
- Android
