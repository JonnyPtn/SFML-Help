# Visual Studio

Visual studio is a fully featured IDE including everything you need to develop c++ programs on windows, and is the easiest and most reliable way to build c++ programs on windows so typically this should be your first choice of tools.

The community edition is free to use and you can download the installer [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

> Make sure to install the "Desktop development with C++" workload to ensure all the required components are installed

Once installed you can download this [template project](https://github.com/JonnyPtn/sfml-vs-vcpkg/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a quick-start. Once downloaded simply open the project in visual studio and hit `F5` to run the app

## With VCPKG

[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) is a cross-platform package manager for c++ projects, which visual studio integrates with for dependency management as used in the template above. 

To add SFML to an existing visual studio project, run the following commands in a visual studio developer command prompt (`Ctrl+'` shortcut in visual studio):
- `vcpkg new --application` Creates the manifest file for your project
- `vcpkg add port sfml` Adds SFML as a dependency for your project

## With CMake

Using [the official cmake template](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project) can also be greatly simplified when using visual studio:
- Open visual studio and select "Clone a repository"
- Enter the URL for the template repository: `https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project`
- Press "Clone"

Visual studio will then clone the source code and configure cmake for you. Once that process has finished you can hit `F5` to run the app
